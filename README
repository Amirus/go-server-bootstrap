Web Authentication in Go: Example
=================================


Go is a new and emerging language that is both fun and easy to learn.

This application is a simple demonstration of how to get a basic application with authentication (via OAuth) up and running using Go.

The OAuth provider used is [Clef.io](https://clef.io/),  a new approach to passwords and mobile-enabled authentication.


Setup
---------

Assuming you already have a working installation of a Go compiler (either gc or gccgo), you simply need to define the OAuth credentials and cookie secret. 

If you want to define these as environment variables (ie, export APP_ID=YOURAPPID), simply create a file named `conf.go` with the following contents:

````go
package main

import "os"

var COOKIE_SECRET = []byte(os.Getenv("COOKIE_SECRET"))
var APP_ID = os.Getenv("APP_ID")
var APP_SECRET = os.Getenv("APP_SECRET")
````

You can also simply hard-code the strings in the conf.go file instead; this file has not been included in the repository because it is already in the .gitignore file, to avoid committing your credentials by mistake.


A Makefile has been included so you can compile and run easily:

````
    $ make && ./build/a.out
````


This library has been tested using gc, though it should work with gccgo as well.
