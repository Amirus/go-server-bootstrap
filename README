Web Authentication in Go: Example
=================================


Go is a new and emerging language that is both fun and easy to learn.

This application is a simple demonstration of how to get a basic application with authentication (via OAuth) up and running using Go.

The OAuth provider used is [Clef.io](https://clef.io/),  a new approach to passwords and mobile-enabled authentication.


Setup
---------

Assuming you already have a working installation of a Go compiler (either gc or gccgo), you simply need to define the OAuth credentials and cookie secret. 

If you want to define these as environment variables (ie, export APP_ID=YOURAPPID), simply define the following environment variables:

````sh
export COOKIE_SECRET = "something secret"
export APP_ID = "your clef app ID"
export APP_SECRET = "your clef app secret" 
export MONGODB_URL= "your mongodb url (without the mongodb:// prefix)"
export MONGODB_DATABASE = "the name of the mongodb database
````

You can also simply hard-code the definitions of the variables in a file named `conf.go` file instead; this file has not been included in the repository because it is already in the .gitignore file, to avoid committing your credentials by mistake.


You can compile and run easily using the `go run` command. Alternatively, use `go install` to compile an executable and install it to `$GOPATH/bin` (you will probably want to add this to your `$PATH` for convenience)


This library has been tested using gc, though it should work with gccgo as well.
